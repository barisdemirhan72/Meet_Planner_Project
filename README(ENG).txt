Hello, welcome to the meeting planning application. With this application, users can plan meetings on a calendar that other users can view by entering their usernames or they can join existing meetings.
When we open the application, we are presented with a screen where we can enter our username. Once we enter the username, you are met with a calendar and two buttons on the left side: "Create Meeting" and "Join Meeting." Below, is a back button that returns you to the login screen and an exit button to exit the application. Pressing the exit button closes the application entirely, while the "X" symbols on the tabs only close the selected pages.

Upon entering the application, the user encounters a "Create Meeting" button, leading to a meeting creation screen. Here, our previously entered username is displayed, and then a calendar appears where we can select a meeting title, description, and possible dates. After clicking the "Create Meeting" button, the meeting file is saved in the ".json" format in a designated bin folder, and a meeting code accessible by other users is generated and copied to the clipboard.
When another user logs into the application and clicks the "Join Meeting" button, they can join a meeting by pasting the copied code. Possible meeting dates are displayed in green color on the calendar, and a new user can click on these dates to confirm the planned meeting in a pop-up window. Once approved by other users, the most suitable date for everyone is scheduled.
Meeting data is stored in ".json" files within a designated bin folder, with each meeting's information stored in a separate JSON file. Right-clicking on JSON files and opening with Notepad reveals data such as the meeting creator, title, possible dates, and description in a text file format. The names of the users who accepted the meeting are shown under possible dates title.
