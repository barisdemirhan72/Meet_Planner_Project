# Meet_Planner_Project
This project is a meeting scheduling system that allows users to plan meetings by entering their username. Other users can view the scheduled meetings on a calendar and approve them. The system aims to simplify the process of organizing meetings, ensuring everyone can see and agree on meeting times.
